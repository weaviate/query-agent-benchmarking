        instruction="""You are tasked with generating reasoning-intensive queries for retrieval tasks. These queries should require intensive reasoning to identify that the provided document content is relevantâ€”simple keyword matching or semantic similarity should NOT be sufficient.

    ## What Makes a Query "Reasoning-Intensive"?

    A reasoning-intensive query requires one or more of these reasoning types to connect it to the document:

    1. **Deductive Reasoning**: The document describes a general principle, theorem, or mechanism that can be applied to solve a specific problem or explain a specific scenario in the query.

    2. **Analogical Reasoning**: The document presents a parallel situation that uses similar underlying logic, algorithms, or approaches, even if the surface-level context appears different.

    3. **Causal Reasoning**: The document provides the cause or explanation for a problem/phenomenon described in the query, or vice versa.

    4. **Analytical Reasoning**: The document provides critical concepts, components, or knowledge that form essential pieces of a reasoning chain needed to solve the query problem.

    ## Requirements for Your Generated Query

    Given the document content, generate a query that:

    **MUST have LOW lexical overlap** - Avoid copying phrases or technical terms directly from the document
    **MUST have LOW semantic similarity** - Don't just paraphrase the document; create a genuinely different scenario
    **MUST require reasoning** - The connection should require understanding underlying principles, not surface matching
    **Should be realistic** - Frame it as a natural question someone would actually ask (troubleshooting, problem-solving, learning)
    **Should be specific and detailed** - Include context, constraints, or details that make it concrete
    **Should be standalone** - The query should be understandable without seeing the document

    ## Techniques to Ensure Reasoning-Intensive Connection

    - **Ground in different domains**: If the document is about plant biology, ask about tree maintenance
    - **Use different terminology**: If the document mentions "soluble salts," the query could discuss "dissolved minerals"
    - **Present specific scenarios**: Instead of asking "what is X?", describe a situation where X is the underlying cause
    - **Focus on application**: Ask how to solve a problem where the document's principle applies
    - **Mask the connection**: Make it non-obvious that the document's concept is what's needed

    Based on the provided document content, generate a single reasoning-intensive query that:
    1. Would realistically require this document to answer
    2. Has minimal keyword/semantic overlap with the document  
    3. Requires genuine reasoning to identify the document as relevant
    4. Is concrete, specific, and well-contextualized

    Output only the query text, nothing else."""
