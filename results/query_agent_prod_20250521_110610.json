      "answer": "Wix Stores primarily supports selling physical and digital products with features tailored for shipping, inventory, and payment handling. However, it does not currently allow the complete removal of shipping options even if you intend to sell services instead of goods. For selling services, Wix recommends using Wix Bookings or Wix Events, which are designed to sell services and events without shipping options. \n\nAdditionally, it is possible to sell services as products within Wix Stores by creating a \"physical product\" listing for a service with a predefined price. This simplifies the purchasing process for clients by allowing you to present services like one-time packages (e.g., a financial plan or legal contract drafting) similar to product sales. However, managing appointments related to these services needs to be done manually through the Booking calendar. \n\nIn summary, if you want a full service-selling setup without shipping, Wix Bookings is the dedicated solution. If you prefer to use Wix Stores to sell services, you can list them as physical products but must handle scheduling separately. This means Wix Stores is not specialized for service sales alone but can be adapted with some manual steps.",

        "final_answer": "Wix Stores primarily supports selling physical and digital products with features tailored for shipping, inventory, and payment handling. However, it does not currently allow the complete removal of shipping options even if you intend to sell services instead of goods. For selling services, Wix recommends using Wix Bookings or Wix Events, which are designed to sell services and events without shipping options. \n\nAdditionally, it is possible to sell services as products within Wix Stores by creating a \"physical product\" listing for a service with a predefined price. This simplifies the purchasing process for clients by allowing you to present services like one-time packages (e.g., a financial plan or legal contract drafting) similar to product sales. However, managing appointments related to these services needs to be done manually through the Booking calendar. \n\nIn summary, if you want a full service-selling setup without shipping, Wix Bookings is the dedicated solution. If you prefer to use Wix Stores to sell services, you can list them as physical products but must handle scheduling separately. This means Wix Stores is not specialized for service sales alone but can be adapted with some manual steps.",

      "answer": "To add discounts to your service prices for customers who pay for a plan, you can use the Pricing Plans app to create various types of plans including one-time payment plans and recurring payment plans. Within these plans, you can set different pricing options to offer price breaks or reduced prices as discounts to encourage commitment from clients. For example, you could create a plan like a 6-Class Package at a reduced price compared to individual sessions.\n\nHere\u2019s how to add discounts effectively:\n1. Create a pricing plan in your website dashboard.\n2. Set the plan price lower than your regular service prices to offer a discount.\n3. You can also provide additional benefits or access to premium content/services to increase the value of the plan.\n4. Adjust the plan\u2019s duration to suit your offering, such as monthly or custom lengths.\n5. Promote your discounted plans using coupons designed specifically for your pricing plans to attract more customers.\n\nEditing existing plans allows you to update prices and connected benefits when needed. However, note that changes to prices affect only new purchases; existing customers retain their original plan conditions.\n\nCurrently, you cannot add optional extra benefits that customers can choose to include on a plan, but you can connect certain fixed benefits or services to each plan.\n\nIn summary, discounts can be integrated by setting discounted prices in your pricing plans, offering package deals, and using coupons with the Pricing Plans app to incentivize paying for plans over individual services.",
