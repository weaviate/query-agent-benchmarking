      "answer": "In Godot Engine, using `add_theme_stylebox_override` correctly on a PanelContainer (or other Control node) requires some important considerations. Your test code snippet is logically sound in terms of calling `add_theme_stylebox_override` and checking overrides; however, the method `get_theme_stylebox` still returns the original stylebox from the theme rather than the overridden one in your case. This could happen because the control does not update its appearance automatically just by adding the override \u2014 it needs to refresh or redraw to reflect the new style override.\n\nKey points to ensure proper usage:\n1. Use `add_theme_stylebox_override(\"normal\", stylebox)` on the Control-derived node (like your PanelContainer) to locally override the \"normal\" stylebox. This is the correct approach instead of setting theme properties manually.\n2. After adding the override, the control may need to be forced to redraw or update for the override to take effect visually. Sometimes calling `update()` or `queue_redraw()` on the control helps.\n3. When calling `get_theme_stylebox`, it can still return the original stylebox from the theme if the theme item does not reflect the override immediately in the method call. The overrides take precedence at render time rather than changing the returned object from this getter.\n\nFrom the example in the search results, when overriding multiple states (normal, hover, pressed) of buttons, they duplicate the existing styleboxes, modify them, then add overrides. They also have other UI elements update accordingly.\n\nIf your intent is to visually change the PanelContainer's background or stylebox, ensure you use `add_theme_stylebox_override` and then force the PanelContainer to update/repaint.

The override takes precedence at render time rather than changing the returned object from this getter. To reflect the override visually, the control often needs to be forced to redraw or update after adding the override (e.g., calling update()).

        "final_answer": "In Godot Engine, using `add_theme_stylebox_override` correctly on a PanelContainer (or other Control node) requires some important considerations. Your test code snippet is logically sound in terms of calling `add_theme_stylebox_override` and checking overrides; however, the method `get_theme_stylebox` still returns the original stylebox from the theme rather than the overridden one in your case. This could happen because the control does not update its appearance automatically just by adding the override \u2014 it needs to refresh or redraw to reflect the new style override.\n\nKey points to ensure proper usage:\n1. Use `add_theme_stylebox_override(\"normal\", stylebox)` on the Control-derived node (like your PanelContainer) to locally override the \"normal\" stylebox. This is the correct approach instead of setting theme properties manually.\n2. After adding the override, the control may need to be forced to redraw or update for the override to take effect visually. Sometimes calling `update()` or `queue_redraw()` on the control helps.\n3. When calling `get_theme_stylebox`, it can still return the original stylebox from the theme if the theme item does not reflect the override immediately in the method call. The overrides take precedence at render time rather than changing the returned object from this getter.\n\nFrom the example in the search results, when overriding multiple states (normal, hover, pressed) of buttons, they duplicate the existing styleboxes, modify them, then add overrides. They also have other UI elements update accordingly.\n\nIf your intent is to visually change the PanelContainer's background or stylebox, ensure you use `add_theme_stylebox_override` and then force the PanelContainer to update/repaint. The presence of the override is correctly indicated by `has_theme_stylebox_override(\"normal\")` returning true, so that part works.\n\nSummary:\n- Your code is correctly adding the override.\n- The stylebox shown by `get_theme_stylebox` may still be the default because this method does not reflect overrides dynamically in its return value.\n- The override effect is visible when the control redraws with the override applied.\n- To see the overridden stylebox visually, ensure the control redraws or is refreshed after the override.\n\nTherefore, to fix the issue, after adding the stylebox override, call `panel.update()` to refresh the control so it uses the overridden stylebox during rendering.",

      "answer": "The error likely occurs because the method name you are trying to use is move_and_slide (all lowercase with underscores), but you wrote Move_Slide in the error description, which is incorrect. The correct method to move a CharacterBody2D towards a target in Godot 4 is move_and_slide, which you have used correctly in your code snippet: move_and_slide(target_position * speed).\n\nHowever, the move_and_slide method in Godot 4 for CharacterBody2D expects the velocity vector to be assigned to the velocity member variable before calling move_and_slide() without parameters. Specifically, you should set the velocity property and then call move_and_slide() like this:\n\n```\nvelocity = target_position * speed\nmove_and_slide()\n```\n\nThis is because move_and_slide uses the internal velocity vector tracked by the CharacterBody2D, updating it while handling collisions and sliding.\n\nYour current code uses move_and_slide(target_position * speed) which is incorrect because move_and_slide does not take arguments in Godot 4 CharacterBody2D API; it uses the velocity property instead.\n\nTo fix the issue, modify your _physics_process as follows:\n\n```\nfunc _physics_process(delta):\n    player_position = player.position\n    target_position = (player_position - position).normalized()\n\n    if position.distance_to(player_position) > 1:\n        velocity = target_position * speed\n        move_and_slide()\n        look_at(player_position)\n```\n\nThis will move the enemy towards the player using the CharacterBody2D's built-in movement method without error. Make sure you don't call move_and_slide with arguments but rather update the velocity property before calling move_and_slide().",

        "final_answer": "The error likely occurs because the method name you are trying to use is move_and_slide (all lowercase with underscores), but you wrote Move_Slide in the error description, which is incorrect. The correct method to move a CharacterBody2D towards a target in Godot 4 is move_and_slide, which you have used correctly in your code snippet: move_and_slide(target_position * speed).\n\nHowever, the move_and_slide method in Godot 4 for CharacterBody2D expects the velocity vector to be assigned to the velocity member variable before calling move_and_slide() without parameters. Specifically, you should set the velocity property and then call move_and_slide() like this:\n\n```\nvelocity = target_position * speed\nmove_and_slide()\n```\n\nThis is because move_and_slide uses the internal velocity vector tracked by the CharacterBody2D, updating it while handling collisions and sliding.\n\nYour current code uses move_and_slide(target_position * speed) which is incorrect because move_and_slide does not take arguments in Godot 4 CharacterBody2D API; it uses the velocity property instead.\n\nTo fix the issue, modify your _physics_process as follows:\n\n```\nfunc _physics_process(delta):\n    player_position = player.position\n    target_position = (player_position - position).normalized()\n\n    if position.distance_to(player_position) > 1:\n        velocity = target_position * speed\n        move_and_slide()\n        look_at(player_position)\n```\n\nThis will move the enemy towards the player using the CharacterBody2D's built-in movement method without error. Make sure you don't call move_and_slide with arguments but rather update the velocity property before calling move_and_slide().",

If you just want collisions so it can't pass through the ground, just add a collision shape as the child of your character. Like this:\nPlayer\n|\n--Sprite2D\n|\n--CollisionShape2D\n\nAlso it would be helpful to send a screenshot of your scene in the editor. Maybe the shape is wrong?\nEDIT: I'm sorry for the late response. The reason is having custom collision detection like that isn't reliable. I would make the player a CharacterBody3D/KinematicBody3D, and put a collision shape as a parent of that. It will automatically do collision.",

      "answer": "The overlapping issue you're experiencing with Area2D colliding and overlapping the ground in Godot likely stems from how the Area2D and its collision shapes are set up relative to the ground and character sprite.\n\nArea2D is used to detect when other CollisionObject2D nodes enter or exit its region, typically defined by CollisionShape2D or CollisionPolygon2D nodes. However, Area2D itself doesn't prevent physical overlap\u2014it only detects it. To solve the overlapping problem, consider these steps:\n\n1. Use a PhysicsBody2D (such as KinematicBody2D or CharacterBody2D) for your character instead of just Area2D. These physics bodies handle collisions and physical responses better for characters standing on floors.\n\n2. Ensure that the CollisionShape2D connected to your Area2D is correctly sized and positioned so it doesn't overlap the ground visually. You might need to adjust the shape position or its margin.\n\n3. Adjust the collision layers and masks to make sure the Area2D is detecting the ground properly and not causing visual overlap issues.\n\n4. If you want to detect when the character is on the ground without causing overlap, use signals emitted by Area2D when bodies enter or exit the area, combined with a physics body handling the actual collision response.\n\n5. Alternatively, you can use ShapeCast2D to perform collision checks by sweeping a shape along a direction, which can help snap characters to floors without visual overlaps.\n\nIn essence, for a platformer or a collision-based game, the character node should be a physics body node with appropriate collision shapes and layers, and Area2D can be used to detect overlaps or triggers but not to prevent visual overlap with ground. Adjusting your nodes and their collision layers, masks, and shape positions accordingly will fix the overlapping.\n\nThis solution is important to properly detect collisions without visual overlap issues, as Area2D alone serves mainly for detection and triggers, not physical collision resolution.",

      "answer": "The issue with your picture not being centered in fullscreen in Godot 4, but correcting itself when resizing the window, is likely due to how your project or scene handles the viewport size and scaling on start in fullscreen mode. When you switch to fullscreen, the viewport or canvas size might not update immediately or correctly, so the position calculations for centering are off. When you resize the window manually (such as by clicking the green resize button), the viewport size updates, and the centering works as expected.\n\nTo fix this, consider the following approaches:\n\n1. Ensure your root Control or CanvasItem node is set to use full rect anchors ( Anchor preset \"Full Rect\"), so it automatically resizes with the window or viewport.\n\n2. Use Godot's stretch settings to handle multiple resolutions and aspect ratios properly:\n   - Go to Project Settings > Display > Window and set the stretch mode to \"canvas_items\".\n   - Set the stretch aspect to \"expand\" to avoid distortion and maintain the aspect ratio.\n\n3. If you are using Control nodes, set the layout of your control to full rect so it will always match the window size.\n\n4. Use an AspectRatioContainer or similar to keep your content inside a consistent area that stays centered as the window or fullscreen size changes.\n\n5. If you manually position the shape or sprite, update its position in a \"_resize\" function connected to the root node's resized signal or the viewport's size change event so it recalculates whenever the window size or fullscreen size changes.\n\n6. For sprites or shapes specifically, if centered is true (which is default for Sprite2D nodes), the origin is centered on the texture. Make sure to also position the sprite relative to the center of the viewport (eg, viewport size / 2).\n\nBy properly anchoring your UI or root nodes and setting the project stretch modes for fullscreen, you ensure that the UI and sprites recenter correctly when entering fullscreen mode without needing a manual resize to trigger updates.\n\nIn summary, the behavior you observe stems from the initial viewport size or scaling not being updated correctly on fullscreen start. Using the right stretch mode and making sure your nodes resize according to the viewport resolves this.",

      ],
      "answer": "To detect mouse clicks or mouse events on an Area2D node in Godot, you should not use the _process(delta) function. Instead, you should use the input event handling system provided by Godot. Area2D nodes emit an \"input_event\" signal that you can connect to respond to mouse clicks and other input events specifically on that Area2D.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n1. Enable input pickup on your Area2D by making sure its collision layer and mask are set properly, and its input_pickable property is true.\n2. Connect the \"input_event\" signal to a method in your script that receives input events.\n3. In that input handler, check if the event is an InputEventMouseButton and verify if the left mouse button was pressed.\n\nExample script for your Area2D called \"area\":\n\n```gdscript\nextends Area2D\n\nfunc _ready():\n    # Connect the input_event signal to a custom handler\n    connect(\"input_event\", self, \"_on_area_input_event\")\n\nfunc _on_area_input_event(viewport, event, shape_idx):\n    if event is InputEventMouseButton and event.button_index == BUTTON_LEFT and event.pressed:\n        print(\"clicked on object\")\n```\n\nKey points:\n- The _process function is for frame updates, not input event detection.\n- The \"input_event\" signal on Area2D receives input events only when the mouse/touch is interacting with the Area2D's collision shape(s).\n- Checking event.button_index == BUTTON_LEFT and event.pressed ensures you detect a left mouse button press.\n\nThis approach is the standard way to handle mouse clicks on Area2D objects in Godot, leveraging Godot's input event system directly rather than polling input states every frame.",

        "final_answer": "To detect mouse clicks or mouse events on an Area2D node in Godot, you should not use the _process(delta) function. Instead, you should use the input event handling system provided by Godot. Area2D nodes emit an \"input_event\" signal that you can connect to respond to mouse clicks and other input events specifically on that Area2D.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n1. Enable input pickup on your Area2D by making sure its collision layer and mask are set properly, and its input_pickable property is true.\n2. Connect the \"input_event\" signal to a method in your script that receives input events.\n3. In that input handler, check if the event is an InputEventMouseButton and verify if the left mouse button was pressed.\n\nExample script for your Area2D called \"area\":\n\n```gdscript\nextends Area2D\n\nfunc _ready():\n    # Connect the input_event signal to a custom handler\n    connect(\"input_event\", self, \"_on_area_input_event\")\n\nfunc _on_area_input_event(viewport, event, shape_idx):\n    if event is InputEventMouseButton and event.button_index == BUTTON_LEFT and event.pressed:\n        print(\"clicked on object\")\n```\n\nKey points:\n- The _process function is for frame updates, not input event detection.\n- The \"input_event\" signal on Area2D receives input events only when the mouse/touch is interacting with the Area2D's collision shape(s).\n- Checking event.button_index == BUTTON_LEFT and event.pressed ensures you detect a left mouse button press.\n\nThis approach is the standard way to handle mouse clicks on Area2D objects in Godot, leveraging Godot's input event system directly rather than polling input states every frame.",

I want something like this:\nfunc _ready():\n    device = project.get_device()\n    project_settings.set_setting(\"window_width\", device.width)\n    project_settings.set_setting(\"window_height\", device.height)\n    project_settings.save()\n\nnote that the code I wrote is not actual GDscript, it's just an example of something I want.\n",

You could instead get the window and set the size, like this:\nget_window().size = Vector2(320, 240)\n\nOr the viewport:\nget_viewport().size = Vector2(320, 240)\n\n\nTo identify the platforms you can use OS.get_name():\nprints(OS.get_name())\n\nOr work with OS.has_feature()\n\nBut better yet, don't do this by code. Instead go to Project Settings and define overrides for the platforms you want.\nFor example, if I want to override the width for Android, I select Viewport Width:\n\nThen select the feature \"android\" from the drop down list at the top:\n\nThen click on add:\n\nThat adds a new \"Viewport Width.android\" property that will be effective on targets that has the feature \"android\" (i.e. on Android platforms):\n\nWhich you can set to whatever you want.",

      "answer": "To ensure your fullscreen Godot game correctly sets the resolution based on the device and OS when launched for the first time, you can use Godot's OS and DisplayServer classes to detect the platform and screen size, then adjust the resolution accordingly. Here's a clear approach in GDScript:\n\n1. Detect the Operating System using `OS.get_name()` to identify the platform (e.g., Windows, macOS).\n2. Get the screen size using `DisplayServer.screen_get_size()`.\n3. Set the window size using `OS.window_size` property or modifying project settings.\n\nYou can implement this in the `_ready()` function of a script that runs at startup. Since you want to configure it only the first time the game launches, consider saving a setting or file flag to remember if the resolution was configured.\n\nExample code snippet:\n\n```gdscript\nfunc _ready():\n    # Detect OS platform\n    var platform = OS.get_name()\n\n    # Get the primary screen size\n    var screen_size = DisplayServer.screen_get_size(0)  # 0 for primary screen\n\n    # Optional: print platform and screen size\n    print(\"Running on: %s\".format(platform))\n    print(\"Screen size: %s\".format(screen_size))\n\n    # Set window size to screen size for fullscreen or desired resolution\n    OS.window_size = screen_size\n\n    # Optionally, set fullscreen mode\n    OS.window_fullscreen = true\n\n    # Save a custom setting or file to skip this on next launch\n    # For example, using ProjectSettings or user:// storage\n    # ProjectSettings.set_setting(\"display/window/size/viewport_width\", screen_size.x)\n    # ProjectSettings.set_setting(\"display/window/size/viewport_height\", screen_size.y)\n    # ProjectSettings.save()\n```\n\nNote that modifying ProjectSettings at runtime affects the current session but does not change the project file persistently for the next run unless you save explicitly. Alternatively, you can save a config file in the user directory (`user://`) to record resolution settings for future runs.\n\nThis solution aligns with Godot's API abilities to detect OS and screen details and set window size accordingly. It allows platform-aware resolution setting on first launch with fullscreen capability. Be sure your project exports support the necessary fullscreen and window size settings for each platform.\n\nIf you want to explore example projects, Godot demo projects on \"Operating System Testing\" and \"Multiple Resolutions and Aspect Ratios\" provide detailed usage of OS and DisplayServer classes for cross-platform screen and resolution handling.",

      "answer": "The issue you're facing with the multiplayer RPG grid system\u2014where items placed by the host are only visible to the host and items placed by the client only appear visible to the client\u2014likely relates to how node synchronization and visibility are handled in Godot's multiplayer system.\n\nYour error message: `get_node: Node not found:\"World/PlayerBuildings/@Camp1@3/MultiplayerSynchronizer\"` and the behavior that items do not appear under the PlayerBuildings node on the remote tab suggests that the MultiplayerSynchronizer responsible for syncing nodes and their properties between peers might not be correctly set up or attached to the nodes that the host places.\n\nAccording to Godot's MultiplayerSynchronizer documentation, this node is used to synchronize properties from the multiplayer authority (usually the host) to remote peers. It manages visibility of nodes for each peer and ensures that nodes are spawned and synchronized properly if set up correctly. You need to ensure that each item placed, especially by the host, is associated with a MultiplayerSynchronizer that has the correct `root_path` pointing to the item node, so it can synchronize its state and visibility across all connected clients.\n\nTypical problems in this scenario include:\n1. The MultiplayerSynchronizer node missing under the host's instance of the PlayerBuildings subtree.\n2. The root_path of the synchronizer not set correctly or the synchronizer not spawned properly for new items.\n3. Visibility filters not configured or updated, so other peers do not get the nodes spawned or shown.\n\nYou might need to:\n- Attach a MultiplayerSynchronizer node to each building/item instance or parent node that requires synchronization.\n- Set the `root_path` of the synchronizer to the item node so it monitors and syncs it correctly.\n- Ensure that after instantiating the item (e.g., camp_fire), you add it properly to PlayerBuildings, and then set up or confirm synchronization for that node.\n- Possibly use the MultiplayerSpawner if automatic spawning and despawning of networked nodes is needed based on synchronizer visibility.\n\nYour current instantiation code does not appear to link the new camp_fire instance with any multiplayer synchronization node or component, which explains why the remote clients don't see the host's items and get_node calls fail.\n\nIn summary, review your architecture to incorporate MultiplayerSynchronizer nodes linked correctly to your grid-placed items. Also verify the network ownership and visibility settings so that objects placed by the host become visible to clients and vice versa. This synchronization setup is crucial for consistent multiplayer state.\n\nIf more specific code or error logs related to the MultiplayerSynchronizer setup or network ownership management are available, sharing those could lead to a more precise solution.",

      "answer": "In your Godot script, to detect which button is pressed during runtime, you should connect each button's \"pressed\" signal to a handler function that receives the button itself as a parameter. This can be done by using the signal connection with the Callable.bind method, binding the button instance or an identifier as an argument. For example, when creating each button in your populate() function, connect its pressed signal like this:\n\n```\nbut.pressed.connect(self._on_button_pressed.bind(but))\n```\n\nThen, define the handler function to receive the button pressed:\n\n```\nfunc _on_button_pressed(button):\n    var index = array.find(button)\n    print(\"Button pressed at index: \" + str(index) + \", File: \" + files[index])\n```\n\nThis way, when a button is pressed, the handler knows which button was clicked by receiving it as an argument, allowing you to find its index in the array or correlate it with your list of files.\n\nUsing this method avoids needing to get instance IDs or other indirect approaches, providing a clean way to know which button triggered the signal during runtime. This approach is supported in Godot's signal connection system where you can bind parameters to the connected function as demonstrated in the documentation and examples.",

      "answer": "The issue you're facing with your Godot 4 game hosted via Flask, where the game doesn't load and you see a spinning circle along with errors related to \"still waiting on run dependencies\" and wasm instantiation, is likely due to missing cross-origin isolation headers and server configuration for serving the WebAssembly and related files properly.\n\nYour Flask server code is currently adding the necessary Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy and Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy headers only on the index.html response but not on the subsequent game asset files such as the index.worker.js or wasm files. Since Godot Web exports require cross-origin isolation (verified by the engine's checks for Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy, Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy headers, and availability of SharedArrayBuffer) for features like threads to work, these headers must be sent on every resource that the game loads, not just the main HTML.\n\nTo fix this, you need to ensure your server sends these headers for all game files, including the .js, .wasm, .worker.js, and other assets, because without these headers consistently present, the browser will block or fail to correctly run the WebAssembly module, causing the \"still waiting on run dependencies\" error and the spinning circle.\n\nAdditionally, make sure that the Flask routes serve the files properly with a 200 status without redirects (avoid 302s), as redirects can interfere with proper header handling and loading.\n\nHere's an improved approach for your Flask server:\n\n- Add the cross-origin isolation headers to all responses serving game files, not only index.html.\n- Consider using Flask's \"after_request\" decorator to add these headers globally for the game route.\n\nExample:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, send_from_directory, after_this_request\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/<game>/')\ndef index(game):\n    response = send_from_directory(f'./{game}', 'index.html')\n    response.headers.add('Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy', 'same-origin')\n    response.headers.add('Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy', 'require-corp')\n    return response\n\n@app.route('/<game>/<path:file>')\ndef game_files(game, file):\n    response = send_from_directory(f'./{game}', file)\n    response.headers.add('Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy', 'same-origin')\n    response.headers.add('Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy', 'require-corp')\n    return response\n\napp.run()\n```\n\nAlso, note that opening the files directly without a server won't meet the cross-origin isolation requirements, so you must test through a properly configured local server.\n\nIf you prefer a simpler option, exporting your game as a Progressive Web App (PWA) can help, as Godot's PWA export sets up a Service Worker that automatically injects these headers for cross-origin isolation.\n\nFinally, ensure your browser supports WebAssembly features required by Godot 4, your browser environment is secure (HTTPS or localhost), and you test with extensions disabled since some extensions cause runtime errors.\n\nImplementing these header and server improvements should resolve the WebAssembly run dependency hang and allow your Godot 4 game to load correctly when served with Flask locally.",

        "aggregation_answer": "Your Flask server must send the Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy and Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy headers consistently on all game asset files, not just index.html, to enable cross-origin isolation required by Godot 4 WebAssembly builds. Without these headers on every response, the browser blocks or delays loading dependencies like wasm-instantiate, causing the game to not load and errors to appear. Modify your Flask routes so that all files under the game folder respond with these headers, such as by adding them in the response for both index.html and other static files. Also, avoid redirects (HTTP 302) as they interfere with this process. Testing by opening files directly without a server fails due to lack of these headers; using a server with proper headers or exporting as a PWA (which injects these headers via a Service Worker) solves the problem. Additionally, testing in browsers without extensions or with required features supported helps avoid unrelated errors.",

        "final_answer": "The issue you're facing with your Godot 4 game hosted via Flask, where the game doesn't load and you see a spinning circle along with errors related to \"still waiting on run dependencies\" and wasm instantiation, is likely due to missing cross-origin isolation headers and server configuration for serving the WebAssembly and related files properly.\n\nYour Flask server code is currently adding the necessary Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy and Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy headers only on the index.html response but not on the subsequent game asset files such as the index.worker.js or wasm files. Since Godot Web exports require cross-origin isolation (verified by the engine's checks for Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy, Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy headers, and availability of SharedArrayBuffer) for features like threads to work, these headers must be sent on every resource that the game loads, not just the main HTML.\n\nTo fix this, you need to ensure your server sends these headers for all game files, including the .js, .wasm, .worker.js, and other assets, because without these headers consistently present, the browser will block or fail to correctly run the WebAssembly module, causing the \"still waiting on run dependencies\" error and the spinning circle.\n\nAdditionally, make sure that the Flask routes serve the files properly with a 200 status without redirects (avoid 302s), as redirects can interfere with proper header handling and loading.\n\nHere's an improved approach for your Flask server:\n\n- Add the cross-origin isolation headers to all responses serving game files, not only index.html.\n- Consider using Flask's \"after_request\" decorator to add these headers globally for the game route.\n\nExample:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, send_from_directory, after_this_request\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/<game>/')\ndef index(game):\n    response = send_from_directory(f'./{game}', 'index.html')\n    response.headers.add('Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy', 'same-origin')\n    response.headers.add('Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy', 'require-corp')\n    return response\n\n@app.route('/<game>/<path:file>')\ndef game_files(game, file):\n    response = send_from_directory(f'./{game}', file)\n    response.headers.add('Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy', 'same-origin')\n    response.headers.add('Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy', 'require-corp')\n    return response\n\napp.run()\n```\n\nAlso, note that opening the files directly without a server won't meet the cross-origin isolation requirements, so you must test through a properly configured local server.\n\nIf you prefer a simpler option, exporting your game as a Progressive Web App (PWA) can help, as Godot's PWA export sets up a Service Worker that automatically injects these headers for cross-origin isolation.\n\nFinally, ensure your browser supports WebAssembly features required by Godot 4, your browser environment is secure (HTTPS or localhost), and you test with extensions disabled since some extensions cause runtime errors.\n\nImplementing these header and server improvements should resolve the WebAssembly run dependency hang and allow your Godot 4 game to load correctly when served with Flask locally.",
