      "answer": "Yes, you can start accepting payments on your site with Wix Payments even while your account is still under verification. Once you have connected Wix Payments and your site is published with the appropriate Premium or Studio plan that allows payment acceptance, customers can complete purchases on your site. This corresponds to the \"Accepting Payments\" status, where payments are accepted but you cannot receive payouts to your bank account until the verification process is complete. \n\nYou need to complete your account setup and submit the required personal and business information for verification. Wix requires up to 7 business days to verify your information. From the time of the first transaction, you have up to 30 days to finish the verification process; otherwise, your Wix Payments account will be suspended, preventing you from accepting payments through Wix Payments. While waiting for verification, payments are accepted but payouts are on hold until verification is complete. \n\nIn summary, you can accept customer payments during verification, but you will not be able to receive payouts to your bank account until Wix completes the verification. Failure to complete verification within 30 days will suspend your account and disrupt payment processing.",
