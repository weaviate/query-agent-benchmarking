      "answer": "Yes, you can start accepting payments on your Wix site while your Wix Payments account is still under verification, but with some important limitations. Once you've connected Wix Payments and started accepting payments, customers can complete their purchases. However, you will not be able to receive payouts to your bank account until the verification process is fully completed and your account becomes active. From the time of the first transaction, you have 30 days to complete your account setup and verification. If the verification is not completed within these 30 days, your Wix Payments account will be suspended, and you will be unable to accept further payments. Additionally, during periods when your account status temporarily reverts to \"Accepting Payments\" due to updates or verifications, you can accept payments, but payouts will be paused until the verification is done. To summarize, you can accept payments on your site during verification, but you cannot receive payouts until the account is fully verified and active. It is essential to complete the verification process promptly to avoid suspension and ensure timely payouts.",

        "answer": "When you purchase a yearly Premium plan, the free domain voucher is not immediately visible at checkout. Instead, the voucher becomes available after you complete the purchase of the plan. You can then claim the voucher by visiting the [Premium Vouchers page](https://manage.wix.com/account/vouchers?referralAdditionalInfo=%7Btheir) in your Wix account. The voucher is valid for two months from the date of purchase, and you can use it to register a domain for free for one year. If you have already purchased the plan and still do not see the voucher, ensure that you meet all eligibility criteria, such as not having purchased a monthly plan or a domain prior to the plan. If issues persist, you can [contact Wix Customer Care](https://support.wix.com/en/article/contacting-wix-customer-care-for-support) for further assistance.",

      "answer": "When you purchase the yearly premium plan for $17.00 that includes a free domain for one year, the free domain voucher does not automatically show up at checkout. Instead, you receive the voucher as a promotional gift after your initial purchase of the yearly plan. You do not need to have the voucher available at checkout to complete your purchase.\n\nHere is how it works:\n1. You purchase the yearly or multi-year Premium plan (the voucher is not included with monthly plans).\n2. After purchasing, go to the Premium Vouchers page in your Wix account where you can see and claim your free domain voucher.\n3. You need to claim the voucher within 2 months of your plan purchase.\n4. Once claimed, you can then redeem the voucher to get your free domain for one year. The voucher enables you to register a new domain or transfer an existing domain to Wix, but it cannot be applied retroactively to a domain purchased before the plan buy.\n5. Claiming the voucher requires entering your payment details, but you will not be charged for the first year of the domain. This is for automatic renewal purposes after the free year.\n\nSo, to answer your question: You must purchase the yearly premium plan first. Then, you will find and activate the free domain voucher in your account\u2019s Premium Vouchers section. The voucher itself does not appear during the plan checkout process. If for some reason you don't see the voucher after purchasing a yearly plan, check if you purchased a monthly plan (which doesn't include the voucher) or if you already purchased a domain prior to the plan. Otherwise, contacting Customer Care is advised for further assistance.",

      "answer": "Yes, the Wix store function can be used to sell services, not just physical goods. According to Wix, you can sell services as products by creating a pre-packaged service with a set price, simplifying the purchasing process for clients. For example, services like financial planning or tax preparation can be sold like products with clear pricing and without requiring clients to book specific dates upfront. To do this, you add Wix Stores to your site, create a new product labeled as a physical product, and configure it as a service with images, description, and pricing.\n\nAdditionally, Wix Bookings integrates with Wix Stores, allowing you to collect payments for booked services alongside store products in the same transaction through mobile POS, and you can manage appointments and collections effectively. However, any appointments related to these services will need to be manually scheduled within the Wix Booking calendar.\n\nTherefore, Wix provides flexible options to sell services either as bundled products or through Wix Bookings, making it suitable for service-based businesses as well as physical goods.\n\nNo information was found about any limitations or restrictions in selling services through Wix Stores besides the manual appointment scheduling requirement.",
