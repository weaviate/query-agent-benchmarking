      "answer": "Yes, you can start accepting payments on your site while your Wix Payments account is still under verification. Once you have connected Wix Payments to your site and started accepting payments, customers can complete their purchases. However, during the verification process, you will not be able to receive payouts to your bank account until the verification is fully completed and your account becomes active. The verification process typically takes up to 7 business days and requires you to submit identity and business information, including documents such as a government-issued photo ID and a bank statement. Importantly, you have 30 days from the first transaction to complete your account setup and verification; otherwise, your account will be suspended and you will no longer be able to accept payments through Wix Payments. Therefore, while verification is pending, accepting payments is possible but receiving payouts is paused until verification is successful.",
