      "answer": "Yes, you can start accepting payments on your Wix site with Wix Payments while your account is still under verification, but there are some important restrictions to note. Once you connect Wix Payments to your site and start accepting payments, the account status will likely be \"Accepting Payments\" during the verification process. During this time, customers can complete their purchases, meaning you can accept payments online. However, you will not be able to receive payouts to your bank account until the verification process is complete. \n\nThe verification process typically requires you to submit personal, business, and bank details along with supporting documents such as a valid government-issued photo ID and a bank statement. This verification can take up to 7 business days. From the time of your first transaction, you have 30 days to complete your setup and verification, otherwise your Wix Payments account will be suspended and you will no longer be able to accept payments through Wix Payments.\n\nSo, in summary:\n- You can accept payments immediately after connecting Wix Payments and before the account is fully verified.\n- You cannot receive payouts until your account is verified and active.\n- You must complete the verification within 30 days of your first payment to avoid suspension.\n- After verification, your account becomes active, and you can receive payouts as scheduled.\n\nTo check and complete your account setup or verification, go to the Accept Payments section in your site's dashboard and follow the prompts. \n\nKeep in mind you must also publish your site and have a Wix Premium or Studio plan that supports payments.\n\nIf you need to update any account details during verification, your ability to accept payments continues, but payouts are temporarily paused again until re-verification is complete.",

      "answer": "Yes, Wix Stores can be used to sell services as well as physical goods. You can list a specific service you provide as a single \"product\" with a predefined price to simplify the purchasing process for clients. For example, services like a \"5-year Family Financial Plan,\" \"Tax Return Preparation,\" or \"Contract Drafting\" can be sold like pre-packaged products. This approach provides clarity on cost and scope and allows clients to pay without committing to specific dates upfront.\n\nTo sell services as products, you need to add Wix Stores to your site and upgrade to a Premium or Studio plan that supports payments. You create a service product by adding it through your site's dashboard where you enter details like name, description, price, and images just as you would with a physical product. Scheduling of appointments related to the service would need to be manually done in the Wix Bookings calendar.\n\nAdditionally, Wix allows charging clients for store products and Wix Bookings services together in the same transaction (such as at a mobile point of sale). Extra features such as tips, coupons, and discounts are also available for these sales.\n\nIn summary, Wix Stores supports selling services by listing them as products, and you can also use Wix Bookings for more traditional service scheduling and payment. This flexibility ensures Wix can handle both physical goods and service sales effectively.",

You can choose to offer a price discount or a percentage discount coupon. You can also choose whether your discount coupons apply to a specific plan or to all your pricing plans.

      "answer": "To add discounts to your service prices when customers pay for a plan, you primarily work with pricing plans that can include either one-time or recurring payment options. You can create pricing plans that offer packages or memberships at reduced prices compared to individual services, effectively applying a discount by bundling benefits together. For example, you might offer a membership plan that includes access to multiple services at a lower monthly rate than purchasing each service separately.\n\nWhen setting up or editing a pricing plan, you can adjust the plan's price and duration to reflect discounted rates. Changes to price affect new purchasers, so you can create special lower-priced plans or packages to offer discounts.\n\nWhile it is not currently possible to directly add optional extra benefits that customers can choose to include for a discount, you can list and connect relevant services and content to the plan to make it attractive.\n\nAdditionally, to promote discounted plans, you can create coupons linked to your pricing plans as a way to offer explicit discounts.\n\nIn summary, to implement discounts when customers pay for a plan:\n1. Create a new pricing plan or edit an existing one.\n2. Set a discounted price for the plan under \"Pricing options\".\n3. Connect the relevant services and benefits that are included in the plan.\n4. Optionally create coupons for additional promotional discounts.\n\nThis approach allows you to offer different pricing tiers, bundles, or packages that effectively provide discounts compared to individual service pricing.\n\nNote: You cannot currently add optional extra benefits that customers selectively include for discounts within a plan, but you can adjust overall prices and benefits connected to the plan.",
