      "answer": "Yes, you can start accepting payments on your site using Wix Payments even while your Wix Payments account is still under verification. Once you connect Wix Payments as a payment method and start receiving payments, customers can complete their purchases. However, you will not be able to receive payouts to your bank account until the verification process is complete. \n\nDuring this verification period, you typically have up to 30 days from the time of the first transaction to complete your account setup and verification; if you do not complete it within this timeframe, your account will be suspended and you will no longer be able to accept payments through Wix Payments. The verification process involves submitting details such as a government issued photo ID, bank statement, and proof of address to confirm your identity and compliance with Wix's terms.\n\nTo begin accepting payments, ensure your site is published and upgraded to a Wix Premium or Studio plan that supports payments. Then, connect Wix Payments and complete the account setup by providing the required information. While your account status is \"Accepting Payments\" but not fully verified, customers can make purchases but payouts are on hold until verification is complete.\n\nIf you update your account details during verification, your status may temporarily revert to \"Accepting Payments,\" allowing payments to be accepted but delaying payouts until re-verification completes, usually within 7 business days.\n\nIn summary, payment acceptance is possible during verification, but receiving payouts depends on completing the verification process within the designated period.",

The voucher is valid for two months from the date of purchase, and you can use it to register a domain for free for one year. If you have already purchased the plan and still do not see the voucher, ensure that you meet all eligibility criteria, such as not having purchased a monthly plan or a domain prior to the plan.

      "answer": "Yes, the Wix Store function can be used to sell services instead of just physical goods. You can sell a specific service as a single \"product\" with a predefined price to simplify the purchasing process. For example, services like financial plans, tax preparation, or legal contract drafting can be sold as pre-packaged products. To do this, you add these services as \"physical products\" in the Wix Stores dashboard, enter relevant details and pricing, and manage appointments manually through Wix Bookings if needed. Additionally, Wix supports charging clients for both Wix Store products and Wix Bookings services together in the same sale, including at a mobile point of sale (POS), allowing features such as adding tips, coupons, and discounts. However, some limitations exist, such as not being able to sell pricing plans or redeem sessions from plans directly at the POS. Overall, Wix provides versatile options to sell services alongside or instead of physical products through its store and booking features.",

        "answer": "To add discounts to your service prices when customers pay for a plan, you can create discount coupons for your pricing plans. You can choose to offer a price discount or a percentage discount coupon. You can also choose whether your discount coupons apply to a specific plan or to all your pricing plans. Your clients redeem the coupon at checkout to take advantage of the discounted plans. Note: Discount coupons for Pricing Plans cover the plans themselves, but not any setup fees you may have enabled. To create discount coupons for your pricing plans:\n\n1. Go to Pricing Plans in your site's dashboard.\n2. Click the More Actions icon at the top.\n3. Click Create a coupon.\n4. Select the type of coupon you want to offer:\n   - $ Discount: Offer a fixed monetary discount amount.\n   - % Discount: Offer a percentage discount.\n5.

Click the Apply to drop-down and choose the relevant pricing plan(s):\n   - All plans: This is applied to all your available pricing plans.\n   - Specific plan: Click the Pricing plan drop-down and select the relevant plan.\n8. Choose how the coupon works with your pricing plans:\n   - First billing cycle: The coupon offers a one-time discount at the start of the pricing plan.\n   - All billing cycles: The coupon offers a recurring discount, every time your client is charged.\n   - Custom: You choose how your coupons work with recurring payments (e.g. give a discount for the first 4 billing cycles).\n9. Select the dates the coupon is valid between.\n10. (Optional) Select the Limit the total number of uses for this coupon checkbox and enter the number of times the coupon can be used.\n11.

      "answer": "To add discounts to your service prices when customers pay for a plan, you can create discount coupons that apply to your pricing plans. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n1. Use the Pricing Plans app on your site, where you can create various types of plans such as one-time payment plans, recurring payment plans, and free plans.\n\n2. Create discount coupons that offer either a fixed amount off (e.g., $20 off) or a percentage discount (e.g., 20% off). These coupons can apply to either all your pricing plans or specific plans.\n\n3. Clients redeem these coupons at checkout to get the discount on the plan price (note that discounts do not apply to any setup fees associated with the plan).\n\n4. When creating a coupon, you can choose to apply the discount either to the first billing cycle, all billing cycles in a recurring plan, or a custom number of billing cycles.\n\n5. You can also set coupon validity dates, usage limits, and whether a client can use a coupon only once.\n\n6. Coupons can be created and managed from your site\u2019s dashboard or via the Wix app.\n\nThis method allows you to effectively offer discounts on your service prices through pricing plans. However, currently, you cannot add optional extra benefits to a pricing plan for customers to choose, nor apply a discount to only one service or product directly on an invoice.\n\nSummarized Steps:\n- Access Pricing Plans in your dashboard.\n- Create or select a pricing plan.\n- Create a coupon (fixed or percentage discount).\n- Define the coupon\u2019s applicability (which plan, billing cycles, duration).\n- Share or distribute the coupon to clients for redemption at checkout.\n\nThis setup enables you to incentivize plan purchases with discounts without altering individual service prices manually.",
