      "answer": "Yes, you can start accepting payments on your Wix site while your Wix Payments account is still under verification. When your account is in the \"Accepting Payments\" status, you have connected Wix Payments as a payment method and customers can complete their purchases on your site. However, during this period, you cannot yet receive payouts to your bank account until the account verification is fully completed.\n\nTo start accepting payments, your site must be published and upgraded to a Wix Premium or Studio plan that supports payments. After this, you need to complete your account setup and provide all necessary information and documentation for verification, which may include personal/business details, photo ID, bank statement, and address verification documents.\n\nWix requires up to 7 business days to review and verify your account and site content. From the time of the first successful transaction, you have 30 days to complete the verification process. If not completed within this timeframe, your account will be suspended, and you will no longer be able to accept payments. Even after activation, further verification may be requested occasionally.\n\nDuring verification, although you can accept payments, payouts are temporarily unavailable until verification concludes successfully. Make sure to check your verification status in the Accept Payments section of your site's dashboard and promptly provide any requested information to avoid suspension.\n\nIn summary, accepting payments while your Wix Payments account is under verification is permitted, but payouts will be on hold until verification is complete and the account becomes active.",

The voucher is valid for two months from the date of purchase, and you can use it to register a domain for free for one year.

Also, collaborators with Billing Manager permissions might have already applied the voucher if you share site management.\n\nThis process means the voucher doesn\u2019t appear as something to activate at checkout but instead is accessed and applied separately after your plan purchase.",

There are free plans sending up to 200 emails monthly, with upgrades available for higher limits. For business email plans like Google Workspace through Wix, upgrading gives you increased storage and more collaborative features, with tiered plans such as Starter, Standard, and Plus offering varying storage from 30GB to 5TB and other features. The upgrade process involves selecting your desired plan and completing the checkout, with any remaining credit from your current plan applied toward the new purchase. Specific pricing details are not provided here, so you would need to review the plan options directly in your service dashboard to see exact costs and compare which best fits your needs. Additionally, it\u2019s noted that when upgrading, billing cycles remain the same, and certain downgrades are not allowed.

There are free plans sending up to 200 emails monthly, with upgrades available for higher limits. For business email plans like Google Workspace through Wix, upgrading gives you increased storage and more collaborative features, with tiered plans such as Starter, Standard, and Plus offering varying storage from 30GB to 5TB and other features. The upgrade process involves selecting your desired plan and completing the checkout, with any remaining credit from your current plan applied toward the new purchase. Specific pricing details are not provided here, so you would need to review the plan options directly in your service dashboard to see exact costs and compare which best fits your needs. Additionally, it\u2019s noted that when upgrading, billing cycles remain the same, and certain downgrades are not allowed. Lastly, upgrading your site plan (distinct from email plans) also has associated costs and benefits but is separate from email planning.",

        "answer": "To add discounts to your service prices when customers pay for a plan, you can create discount coupons for your pricing plans. You can choose to offer a price discount or a percentage discount coupon. You can also choose whether your discount coupons apply to a specific plan or to all your pricing plans. Your clients redeem the coupon at checkout to take advantage of the discounted plans. Note: Discount coupons for Pricing Plans cover the plans themselves, but not any setup fees you may have enabled. To create discount coupons for your pricing plans:\n\n1. Go to Pricing Plans in your site's dashboard.\n2. Click the More Actions icon at the top.\n3. Click Create a coupon.\n4. Select the type of coupon you want to offer:\n   - $ Discount: Offer a fixed monetary discount amount.\n   - % Discount: Offer a percentage discount.\n5. Enter the Coupon code clients use to redeem the coupon.\n6. Enter the Coupon name for your own records.\n7. Click the Apply to drop-down and choose the relevant pricing plan(s):\n   - All plans: This is applied to all your available pricing plans.\n   - Specific plan: Click the Pricing plan drop-down and select the relevant plan.\n8. Choose how the coupon works with your pricing plans:\n   - First billing cycle: The coupon offers a one-time discount at the start of the pricing plan.\n   - All billing cycles: The coupon offers a recurring discount, every time your client is charged.\n   - Custom: You choose how your coupons work with recurring payments (e.g. give a discount for the first 4 billing cycles).\n9. Select the dates the coupon is valid between.\n10. (Optional) Select the Limit the total number of uses for this coupon checkbox and enter the number of times the coupon can be used.\n11.

      "answer": "When customers pay for a plan and you want to add discounts to your service prices, one recommended approach is to use pricing plans that bundle services with discounted pricing.

To do this, you typically create a pricing plan in your website dashboard, specify the services included in the plan, and set the discounted price for that plan.\n\nSteps to add discounts through pricing plans:\n1. Create a new pricing plan in your site's dashboard, giving it a name and description.\n2. List the included services and content that come with this plan; these represent the benefits customers receive.\n3. Set the price for the plan, which can be lower than the sum of individual service prices to offer a discount.\n4. Define the plan's duration and payment frequency (one-time or recurring).\n5. Optionally, you can add policies, custom form fields, and other settings to tailor the plan experience.\n\nNote, however, that the current system does not allow adding optional extra benefits to a plan where customers can choose them individually for additional fees. All benefits connected to a plan apply to all customers who purchase it.\n\nYou can also manage and update existing plans and their connected benefits, including their prices and durations, but price changes will only affect new customers, not existing clients under existing plans.\n\nTo encourage customers to try your plans, consider offering trial or free plans alongside discounted bundle plans.\n\nIn summary, instead of adding discounts directly to individual service prices when customers pay via a plan, you provide them a bundled pricing plan that offers access to multiple services at a discounted combined rate.\n\nIf you want to promote your plans further, creating coupons linked to your pricing plans can be an effective approach.",
