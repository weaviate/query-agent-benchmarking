# Pre-Built Benchmarks

## BEIR

Published by Thakur et al. in 2021, BEIR was designed to evaluate the out-of-distribution generalization capabilities of retrieval systems. We focused on 3 subsets: Natural Questions (3,452 queries), SciFact (300 queries), and FiQA (648 queries). Natural Questions presents a large-scale retrieval challenge with 2.7 million documents, whereas SciFact and FiQA are smaller scale corpora focused on particular domains such as scientific papers and financial questions, respectively.

## LoTTe

Similarly to BEIR, LoTTe, short for, Long-Tailed Topic-stratified Evaluation, was developed to test how well search systems can generalize to particular domains. LoTTe interestingly uses natural search queries from Google, via GooAQ) mapped to StackExchange answers. Each benchmark in LoTTe contains two query sets, “search” and “forum”: "search" queries are derived from Google autocomplete, and "forum" queries are derived from StackExchange post titles. There are 2002 and 661 “forum” and “search” queries in LoTTe Lifestyle, respectively. There are 2002 and 924 “forum” and “search” queries in LoTTe Recreation, respectively.

## BRIGHT

BRIGHT was introduced by Su et al. as a testbed for level 3 retrieval. While level 1 is keyword search and level 2 is semantic search, level 3 represents the frontier: reasoning-intensive retrieval. Unlike the other benchmarks we included, BRIGHT’s queries are long and descriptive. Sampled from user posts on StackExchange, each query is paired with gold documents sourced from external web pages cited in accepted or highly upvoted answers. There are 103, 116, 103, 101, and 101 queries in the respective Biology, Earth Science, Economics, Psychology, and Robotics subsets we test with. They further contain average query lengths of 115, 109, 182, 150, and 819 tokens, respectively. These query lengths highlight how BRIGHT forces retrieval systems to go beyond surface matching and utilize complex reasoning to find relevant search results.

## EnronQA

EnronQA uniquely addresses the challenge of retrieval over private corpora – 103,638 emails across 150 distinct user inboxes from the Enron corpus. We run our tests with a sample of 500 queries from the largest user inbox, dasovich-j. EnronQA uses synthetic queries derived from these emails. This is an interesting emerging technique for benchmarking information retrieval without having to manually annotate queries and their gold documents. For those interested, we have a recipe here showing how you can achieve this with the Weaviate Transformation Agent.

## WixQA

Wix.com is a website building and hosting platform serving millions of users who encounter technical challenges ranging from domain configuration, payment processing, or design customization, to give a few examples. We use the Expert Written queries, containing 200 customer queries submitted through Wix support channels. Each of these questions are paired with comprehensive answers and gold documents manually authored by Wix support specialists.
