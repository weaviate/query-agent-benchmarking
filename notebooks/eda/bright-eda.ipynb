      "It is likely that some level of adaptation occurred after the loss of the GULO gene by primates. Erythrocyte Glut1 and associated dehydroascorbic acid uptake modulated by stomatin switch are unique traits of humans and the few other mammals that have lost the ability to synthesize ascorbic acid from glucose. As GLUT transporters and stomatin are ubiquitously distributed in different human cell types and tissues, similar interactions may occur in human cells other than erythrocytes.\n",
      "Linus Pauling observed that after the loss of endogenous ascorbate production, apo(a) and Lp(a)  were greatly favored by evolution, acting as ascorbate surrogate, since the frequency of occurrence of elevated Lp(a) plasma levels in species that had lost the ability to synthesize ascorbate is great. Also, only primates share regulation of CAMP gene expression by vitamin D, which occurred after the loss of GULO gene.\n",
      "Johnson et al. have hypothesized that the mutation of the GULOP pseudogene so that it stopped producing GULO may have been of benefit to early primates by increasing uric acid levels and enhancing fructose effects on weight gain and fat accumulation.

      "I am not a biology student but I do know that our eyes have cones which specialize in color perception, and that there are different types of cone cells to perceive different types of colors (If I remember my high school biology correctly).\n",
      "So, I somewhat get a feeling of what's happening inside my eyes (or the brain perhaps?). I suspect that as I go to area G, my eyes 'adapt' to the dominance of bluish/green light, either by decreasing pigment of blue cones or by increasing pigment of red cones, which makes my eyes more sensitive to the other end of visible light spectrum (red-yellow), causing an 'outburst' of red coloration in area 'Y'. Since pigments need time to degrade, by the time the red color pigment of my cones decreases, its activity is less than normal. It may be increased as the blue pigment's activity is less than normal and I see a reddish tinge for few moments.\n",
