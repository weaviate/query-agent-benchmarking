      "Question 3: how does quantum computing work?\n",
      "Answer: Quantum computing works by utilizing the principles of quantum mechanics, specifically superposition and entanglement. Unlike classical bits that represent either a 0 or a 1, quantum bits (qubits) can exist in multiple states simultaneously. This allows quantum computers to perform complex calculations at much higher speeds than classical computers by processing a vast amount of possibilities at once.\n",

      "Answer: The theory of relativity, developed by Albert Einstein, consists of two parts: special relativity and general relativity. Special relativity, introduced in 1905, focuses on the physics of objects moving at constant speeds, particularly at speeds close to the speed of light. It introduces concepts such as time dilation and length contraction, and establishes that the laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion. General relativity, published in 1915, extends these principles to include acceleration and gravity, describing gravity as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass. Together, these theories revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity.\n",
