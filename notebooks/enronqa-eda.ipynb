I need some specific direction with exactly what you would like us to have our clients do. I see this as breaking our market down into the following as each are effected a bit differently:\\n\\n- a specific alignment with the contracts we signed in August\\n- those clients we are marketing to, and can't sign a new contract due to the suspension\\n- existing clients whom we are risk with if there are ANY restrictions on extensions\\n\\nSuggest that we set-up a call on Mon or Tues. Would like myself, Angela Schwarz, Lamar Frazier, David Cox, Gayle Muench and Michael Mann in attendance\\n=====================================\"}"
